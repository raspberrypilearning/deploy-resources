# Contributing

This repository is for the use of Raspberry Pi team members only.

## Adding a repository

To add a repository, simply edit [resources.txt](resources.txt) and add the repository name on a new line.

The repository must exist under [github.com/raspberrypilearning](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning) and must be **public**. The repository name should be lowercase with hyphens between words, e.g. `example-resource`.

Adding the repository to this list will deploy it to the [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org) at `raspberrypi.org/learning/{repo-name}`. All repositories in the list are updated every hour.

If the repository URL changes, please update it in the list.

Note the resource also needs creating in WordPress for it to be displayed in the resources section.
