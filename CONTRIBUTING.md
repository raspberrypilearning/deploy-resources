This repository is for the use of Raspberry Pi team members only.

## Adding a repository

To add a repository, simply edit [live.txt](live.txt) and add the repository name on a new line.

The repository must exist under [github.com/raspberrypilearning](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning) and must be **public**. The repository name should be lowercase with hyphens between words, e.g. `example-resource`.

Adding the repository to this list will deploy it to the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) at `raspberrypi.org/learning/{repo-name}`. All repositories in the list are updated every hour.

## Staging

To add a repository to the staging site, add it to [staging.txt](staging.txt) in the same way.

## Updating

If the repository URL changes, please update it in the list.

Note the resource also needs creating in WordPress for it to be displayed in the resources section.
